<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to fix a row in GridControl</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates how to provide the capability to fix a row in GridControl. 
Our GridControl doesn't have the capability to fix a row. So, to provide this capability in this sample, we manipulate
the child collection of the HeirarchyPanel. We add a StackPanel with a collection of editors to the child
collection of the HeirarchyPanel and bind them to respective cells of the selected row. Then, we assign
it to a ScrollChanged event of the ScrollViewer. When ScrollChanged raises, we change the location of the StackPanel, so it is always displayed on the top of the grid view.
Please note, that this approach is not compatible with Bands and Conditional Formatting. Also, a fixed row may not be displayed immediately when PerPixelScrolling is enabled.</p>
